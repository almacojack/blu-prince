## ANSWERS TO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

### How do uploads work in a cartridge?

**Web Browser:**
```javascript
// File API → canvas resize → store in cart state
const file = await fileInput.files[0];
const reader = new FileReader();
reader.onload = (e) => {
  // Resize to max 1024px
  const img = new Image();
  img.onload = () => {
    const canvas = resizeToMax(img, 1024);
    const base64 = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.8);
    // Save to cart state
    cart.state.pendantImage = base64;
  };
  img.src = e.target.result;
};
```

**MicroPython:**
```python
# Camera capture → save to flash → reference in state
import camera
frame = camera.capture()
with open('/flash/pendant.jpg', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(frame)
cart.state['pendantImage'] = '/flash/pendant.jpg'
```

### Does it save offline?

**Yes.** Storage layers:
- **Web:** IndexedDB via localForage
- **MicroPython:** Flash filesystem
- **Both:** Cart state persists automatically

### Offline queue + online sync?

**Yes. The SyncOrchestrator:**
1. All network operations go through Outbox
2. If offline → queue in Outbox (IndexedDB or flash)
3. When online detected → replay Outbox in order
4. Retry with backoff on failures
5. StatusState emits events for UI updates

```typescript
// Example usage
await syncOrchestrator.enqueue({
  type: 'order',
  payload: { image: base64, chain: 'gold', size: '1inch' }
});
// Queued if offline, sent if online
```

### StatusState for reactive display?

**Yes.** Global reactive object all widgets can subscribe to:

```typescript
statusState.subscribe('network', (network) => {
  wifiIcon.visible = network.online;
  wifiIcon.signal = network.signal;
});

statusState.subscribe('controllers', (controllers) => {
  controllerBadge.count = controllers.length;
});

statusState.subscribe('sync', (sync) => {
  pendingBadge.count = sync.pendingOperations;
});
```

## HARDWARE WORKSHOP: THE INVENTOR'S PLAYGROUND

### The Vision

Blu-Prince is not just a design tool—it's the **canvas where physical products are born**. Products designed in Blu-Prince can be:
1. **Prototyped** - 3D print directly from the editor
2. **Demonstrated** - Interactive physics simulation for sales
3. **Sold** - The same 3D model becomes the shopping experience
4. **Manufactured** - Export to CNC, laser cutter, robotic arm

### Physical Products in Development

| Product | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Gameboy-like Handheld** | Custom Linux handheld running TingOS | In development |
| **Modular Sensor Controls** | Magnetic-bonding input modules | Prototyping |
| **Keyboard Clamp** | Seats mini keyboard on handhelds | Design phase |
| **Magnetic Desk System** | Flexible arms + magnetic bases for metal desks | Conceptual |
| **Cup Holder Mount** | Fits cup holders, holds phones/devices | Conceptual |

### Partnership Target: Solder Party (Sweden)

- Professional keyboard designer
- Makes excellent small form-factor keyboards
- Potential collaboration on keyboard clamp accessory

### Product Configurator: Touch-and-Feel Physics

The killer feature: **customers can FEEL the product before buying.**

**New Physics Forces:**
| Force Type | Behavior | Use Case |
|------------|----------|----------|
| `magnet_attract` | Pulls toward magnetic surfaces | Magnetic bases gripping desk |
| `magnet_repel` | Pushes away from like poles | Snap-together orientation |
| `spring_joint` | Elastic force when stretched/compressed | Flexible arms, tensioned mounts |
| `hinge_joint` | Rotates around axis with limits | Folding stands, adjustable arms |
| `damper` | Resists motion smoothly | Smooth rotation, premium feel |

**Interactive Shopping Experience:**
1. **Rotate** - Spin product with mouse/touch/gamepad
2. **Pull** - Stretch springs, feel tension feedback
3. **Snap** - Magnetic surfaces attract and lock
4. **Fold** - Hinges rotate with physics
5. **Drop** - See how it lands, test stability
6. **Mount** - Place on virtual desk surface

```typescript
// Example: Magnetic desk arm in Product Configurator
const magneticArm = {
  base: {
    forces: [
      { type: 'magnet_attract', target: 'metal_surface', strength: 50 }
    ]
  },
  arm: {
    joints: [
      { type: 'hinge_joint', axis: 'y', limits: [-45, 45] }
    ]
  },
  deviceMount: {
    forces: [
      { type: 'spring_joint', stiffness: 100, damping: 0.3 }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Why This Sells

1. **See the magnet snap** - Watch the base grip the desk
2. **Feel the spring tension** - Drag the arm, see it bounce back
3. **Test stability** - Drop a virtual phone in the holder
4. **Customize options** - Pick colors, arm lengths, accessories
5. **Instant confidence** - "I know exactly what I'm buying"

**Traditional e-commerce:** Static photos, trust the description
**Blu-Prince commerce:** Physics simulation, experience before purchase

### Multiple Statecharts Per Cart

**TOSS v1.1 Schema Update:**

Products with complex behavior need multiple coordinated state machines:

```typescript
interface TOSSv1_1 {
  version: '1.1';
  manifest: {...};
  
  // NEW: Multiple named statecharts
  statecharts: {
    [chartId: string]: {
      role: 'ui' | 'physics' | 'network' | 'logic' | 'custom';
      fsm: FSMDefinition;
      context: Record<string, any>;
    }
  };
  
  // Event bus for cross-chart communication
  eventBus: {
    channels: string[];
    subscriptions: { chartId: string; channel: string; event: string }[];
  };
  
  // Backward compat: legacy single FSM still works
  fsm?: FSMDefinition;
}
```

**Example: Magnetic Desk Arm Cart**
- `ui` chart: Controls what screen shows (product view, checkout, customization)
- `physics` chart: Manages force states (gripping, releasing, bouncing)
- `config` chart: Tracks user selections (color, size, accessories)

All three coordinate via event bus without coupling.

### Hardware Cartridge Profile

For physical products, carts include manufacturing data:

```typescript
interface HardwareProfile {
  productId: string;
  manufacturingData: {
    stlFiles: Asset3D[];
    bomItems: { partNumber: string; quantity: number }[];
    assemblyNotes: string;
  };
  firmwareTarget?: {
    mcu: 'esp32' | 'rp2040' | 'stm32';
    radioStack?: 'lora' | 'ble' | 'wifi';
    calibration: Record<string, number>;
  };
  packaging: {
    boxDimensions: [number, number, number];
    weight: number;
    shippingClass: 'standard' | 'oversized' | 'fragile';
  };
}
```

### The Full Loop

1. **Invent** in Blu-Prince (3D + physics + statecharts)
2. **Prototype** via 3D print export
3. **Iterate** with physics simulation
4. **Sell** using interactive configurator
5. **Manufacture** with exported BOM and STL
6. **Ship** hardware cart with firmware pre-loaded
7. **Support** via software cart updates

**Blu-Prince is the inventor's playground.** Every product you imagine can be simulated, sold, and shipped—from the same source of truth.
