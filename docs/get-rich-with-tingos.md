# How to Get Rich with TingOS: A Builder's Journey

*A story about turning simulation tools into sustainable wealth*

---

## Chapter 1: The Cartridge Economy

Maya was a designer who spent her nights building small interactive experiences. She discovered TingOS on a random Tuesday and everything changed.

"Wait," she said, staring at **Blu-Prince**. "I can build an entire state machine... visually?"

She dragged her first node onto the canvas. A glowing icosahedron materialized in the 3D viewport. She added states: `idle`, `hover`, `selected`, `purchased`. Drew transitions between them. Watched the Vector Arcade statechart come alive with neon traces connecting her logic.

Her first TOSS cartridge was born in 47 minutes.

## Chapter 2: The Misfit Toys

Maya's friend Derek ran a vintage toy shop that was dying. "Nobody wants this stuff anymore," he sighed, gesturing at shelves of forgotten playthings.

"What if they could *experience* them first?" Maya opened **unwanted.ad** on her laptop.

Each toy became a cartridge. The wind-up robot? She gave it states for `wound`, `walking`, `falling_over`, `rewinding`. Buyers could simulate the toy before bidding. Watch it wobble. Hear it click.

Derek's first auction closed at 3x his asking price.

"People don't want to buy things," Maya realized. "They want to buy *stories*. And stories are just state machines with good transitions."

## Chapter 3: The Art Dealer's Secret

Word spread. A gallery owner named Reyes contacted Maya through **artsy.sale**.

"I have clients who want provenance," Reyes explained. "They want to know an artwork's journey."

Maya built cartridges that tracked each piece: `created` -> `exhibited` -> `sold` -> `stored` -> `loaned` -> `restored`. Each transition stored metadata—dates, locations, handlers. The QR codes from **tng.li** linked physical frames to their digital histories.

Collectors paid premiums for art with rich state histories. "This piece has been through 47 transitions," became a selling point.

Reyes gave Maya 15% of every premium sale.

## Chapter 4: The Scheduling Empire

Maya's calendar was chaos. She built **l8r.co** for herself first—appointments as cartridges.

But then she noticed: every appointment had states. `scheduled` -> `reminded` -> `confirmed` -> `attended` -> `followed_up`. She could automate the transitions. Add guards. "If no confirmation after 24 hours, send reminder."

She licensed the scheduling cartridge to three coaching businesses. $200/month each.

Then ten more. Then fifty.

"I'm not selling software," she told Derek over coffee. "I'm selling *time*. Packaged as state machines."

## Chapter 5: The Trader's Playbook

A crypto trader named Jin found Maya through **coins.rip**. He wanted to visualize his trading strategies.

"Every trade is a decision tree," Jin explained. "But I can't see my own patterns."

Maya built him a cartridge: `watching` -> `analyzing` -> `entering` -> `holding` -> `exiting`. Each state had entry conditions. Each transition had guards based on price movements, volume, sentiment.

Jin's first month using the visualization: +34%.

He paid Maya $5,000 for a custom cartridge that mapped his entire playbook. Then he started selling copies to his Discord.

## Chapter 6: The Physics of Wealth

Maya looked at her income streams:

- **Cartridge sales on unwanted.ad**: $2,400/month
- **Artsy.sale commissions**: $4,800/month  
- **l8r.co subscriptions**: $10,000/month
- **Custom cartridge builds**: $8,000/month
- **Licensing to Jin's community**: $3,200/month

$28,400/month. From state machines.

She opened the **editor** and spawned a new solid. Watched it drop through the physics simulation, bounce off Ground Zero, settle into place.

"Wealth," she typed into her notes, "is just a state machine where more transitions lead to `income` than to `expense`."

---

## Chapter 7: The Multiplier

Maya hired two developers. Taught them Blu-Prince. They built cartridges faster than she ever could.

She built a cartridge to manage *them*: `available` -> `assigned` -> `building` -> `reviewing` -> `shipping`. The **FlightControlsDashboard** let her navigate between all active projects in 3D space.

Each employee became a node. Each project a transition. She could see bottlenecks in real-time.

"The map isn't the territory," she told her team. "But a good statechart is damn close."

---

## Chapter 8: The Exit

A larger company offered $2.4 million for Maya's cartridge library and l8r.co.

She opened the home page, scrolled to the **Quick Navigation** section. Looked at all the tools: Blu-Prince, Editor, Statechart, Controller, Library, Simulator, Playground, Data Tables, Vault, Utilities, and the satellite domains.

"No," she said.

"Why?" they asked.

"Because I'm not selling a product. I'm selling a *capability*. And capabilities compound."

She kept building.

## The Moral

Getting rich isn't about one big win. It's about building systems—state machines—where each state naturally transitions to higher-value states.

TingOS gives you the tools:

- **Blu-Prince** to design your logic visually
- **The Editor** to simulate physics and test your ideas
- **Statecharts** to see your systems in 3D
- **tng.li** to connect physical and digital with QR codes
- **Satellite domains** to reach different markets

The Gameboy-style controller in your corner? That's not for games. That's for navigating your empire.

Drag it wherever you need it.

*"Every business is a state machine. Most people just can't see the transitions."*
