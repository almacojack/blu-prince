# Why This. Why Now. Why Us.

## A Personal Case for Taking the Leap

### To the Partner Who Needs to See It

You've heard the pitches before. The late-night enthusiasm. The "this time it's different." The whiteboards full of arrows and boxes that somehow never become money in the bank.

This document isn't another pitch. It's a map of the territory we've already crossed, the assets we already hold, and the specific path from where we are to where the money is.

**The ask isn't blind faith. The ask is: look at what already exists.**

---

## Part I: What We Already Have

### The Technical Foundation (Built, Working, Demonstrable)

| Component | Status | What It Proves |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| TOSS file format | Complete | We can package interactive experiences |
| Runtime engine | Working | Cartridges actually execute |
| Visual editor (Blu-Prince) | Functional | Non-programmers can create |
| Multi-cart loading | Implemented | Composability is real |
| CLI command system | Working | Developer-friendly tooling exists |
| Authentication | Integrated | Users can own their content |
| Database storage | Active | Persistence works |

**This isn't a mockup. This isn't a prototype. This is a platform.**

### The Domain Portfolio (Secured, Strategic)

- **thingos.org** - The core platform
- **tng.li** - Short links for distribution (like bit.ly for cartridges)
- **blu-prince.com** - The design tool brand
- **unwanted.ad** - Auction vertical
- **artsy.sale** - Art dealer vertical
- **coins.rip** - Crypto visualization vertical
- **l8r.co** - Scheduling vertical

**Each domain is a potential revenue stream. Each represents a market we can enter without building new technology.**

### The Unfair Advantages (Personal, Non-Replicable)

1. **Deep technical experience** - Not learning as we go; applying decades of knowledge
2. **Retro gaming passion** - Authentic connection to the target audience
3. **Cross-platform fluency** - Web, embedded, IoT, MicroPython—all one codebase
4. **Design sensibility** - The aesthetic isn't an afterthought; it's the product
5. **No outside investors (yet)** - We own 100% and control the timeline

## Part II: The Money Path

### Revenue Stream 1: Marketplace Commissions

**The math that matters:**

```
1,000 creators making cartridges
× 10 cartridges each = 10,000 cartridges
× $10 average price = $100,000 GMV
× 20% platform take = $20,000/month revenue

At 10,000 creators: $200,000/month
At 100,000 creators: $2,000,000/month
```

**Comparison:** itch.io has 500,000+ developers. We need 0.2% of that market.

### Revenue Stream 2: Pro Subscriptions

Creators pay for advanced features:

| Tier | Price | Features | Target Conversion |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Free | $0 | 3 cartridges, basic editor | 100% of signups |
| Indie | $9/mo | Unlimited, analytics | 5% conversion |
| Studio | $29/mo | Team features, priority | 1% conversion |
| Enterprise | $299/mo | White-label, API access | 0.1% conversion |

**At 10,000 users:**
- 500 Indie × $9 = $4,500/mo
- 100 Studio × $29 = $2,900/mo
- 10 Enterprise × $299 = $2,990/mo
- **Total: $10,390/month recurring**

### Revenue Stream 3: Training & Certification

Corporate training buyers pay premium:

| Product | Price | Annual Sales Target | Revenue |
|---------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| Self-paced course | $49 | 1,000 | $49,000 |
| Certification exam | $199 | 200 | $39,800 |
| Enterprise training | $2,999/seat | 50 seats | $149,950 |
| **Year 1 Total** | | | **$238,750** |

### Revenue Stream 4: Infrastructure Hosting

Long-term play: cartridge-based web hosting

**Conservative Year 3 scenario:**
- 1,000 sites using cartridge hosting
- $50/month average
- **$50,000/month = $600,000/year**

### Combined Projection

| Year | Marketplace | Subscriptions | Training | Hosting | Total |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | $60K | $40K | $50K | $0 | $150K |
| 2 | $300K | $150K | $150K | $100K | $700K |
| 3 | $1M | $400K | $300K | $600K | $2.3M |

**This is conservative. This assumes no viral moments, no major partnerships, no acquisition interest.**

## Part III: Why The Timing Is Perfect

### Market Conditions (External)

1. **Retro gaming at peak popularity** - $15B market, 8% annual growth
2. **No-code tools plateauing** - Users hitting complexity ceilings, ready for next evolution
3. **Cloud fatigue setting in** - Customers want predictable pricing
4. **WebGPU just shipped** - Browser-based 3D finally viable
5. **MicroPython matured** - Embedded development accessible to web developers

### Personal Conditions (Internal)

1. **Skills at peak** - Technical abilities honed over career
2. **Market knowledge deep** - Understand both developer and end-user needs
3. **Energy available** - Ready to commit fully
4. **Risk tolerance calibrated** - Know what we're getting into
5. **Support system in place** - Partnership makes this possible

### Competitive Window

**18-24 months before well-funded competitors notice.**

The components exist (game engines, no-code tools, container systems) but nobody has assembled them this way. By the time they do, we have:
- Established creator community
- Marketplace network effects
- Brand recognition in retro space
- Enterprise reference customers

| Solving problems we imagined | Solving problems we've experienced |
| Building for hypothetical users | Building for ourselves first |
| Technology in search of market | Market validated, technology built |
| Hoping for revenue model | Revenue model designed into architecture |
| Solo effort | Partnership with complementary strengths |

### Different from Competitors

| Competitor Type | Their Weakness | Our Advantage |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Unity/Unreal | Overkill for simple projects | Right-sized for indie creators |
| No-code tools | Can't express complex logic | FSM is visual AND powerful |
| Game marketplaces | 30% cut, locked ecosystems | Fair splits, portable format |
| Cloud providers | Opaque pricing, vendor lock-in | Predictable, swappable |

### Different from "Just a Job"

| Employment | This Venture |
|------------|--------------|
| Trade time for money | Build equity in asset |

## Part V: The Safety Net

### What We're NOT Risking

1. **Not quitting jobs immediately** - Build until revenue justifies transition
2. **Not taking investor money** - No dilution, no pressure, no board meetings
3. **Not betting savings** - Bootstrap with skills, not capital
4. **Not burning bridges** - Professional reputation remains intact
5. **Not ignoring reality** - Clear metrics for go/no-go decisions

### Decision Checkpoints

| Milestone | Timeline | Go/No-Go Criteria |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| MVP complete | Done | Technical viability proven |
| First 100 users | 3 months | Interest validated |
| First $1,000 revenue | 6 months | Willingness to pay confirmed |
| First $10,000/month | 12 months | Sustainable business possible |
| Quit-ready threshold | 18 months | Revenue replaces one salary |

**If we don't hit milestones, we haven't lost—we've learned. The skills transfer. The code is ours. The domains retain value.**

| Partner | Emotional support, reality checks, patience | Equity stake, shared upside |
| Together | Time investment, belief in each other | Something we built, not inherited |

### The Commitment

1. **6 months of focused effort** - Nights, weekends, every spare hour
2. **Clear communication** - Weekly updates on progress and challenges
3. **Honest assessment** - If it's not working, we acknowledge it
4. **Shared celebration** - Wins are our wins, not just mine
5. **Exit strategy if needed** - Know when to pivot vs. persist

### The Promise

This isn't about getting rich (though that's possible). This is about:
- Building something meaningful
- Using skills we've developed
- Creating on our terms
- Proving something to ourselves
- Not wondering "what if" for the rest of our lives

## Conclusion: The Real Question

The question isn't "Is this a good idea?"

Look at what exists. Look at the market. Look at the timing. Look at our capabilities.

**The question is: "If not now, when? If not us, who?"**

We have the skills. We have the vision. We have the foundation built.

The opportunity is sitting there. The window is open.

**Are we catching it?**
