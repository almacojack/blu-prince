# The TingOS Shark Tank Pitch
## A Fictional (But Likely) Scenario

---

*[The entrepreneur walks confidently down the corridor into the Tank. The sharks lean forward as they notice the retro gaming aesthetic—a custom-built handheld device glowing with neon accents.]*

---

### THE PITCH

**Entrepreneur:** "Hello Sharks! My name is [Name], and I'm seeking $500,000 for 10% equity in TingOS—the operating system for the next generation of interactive experiences.

Let me ask you something. How many of you remember the magic of putting a cartridge into a game console? That satisfying click. The instant-on. The way everything just *worked*?"

*[Mark Cuban nods. Kevin O'Leary leans back with interest.]*

**Entrepreneur:** "That magic died when everything moved to the cloud. Downloads. Updates. Subscriptions. Accounts. Passwords. The friction killed the fun.

We're bringing it back.

TingOS is a platform where interactive experiences—games, tools, simulations, training modules—are packaged as digital cartridges. One file. Instant load. Works everywhere. And here's the kicker..."

*[Holds up the glowing handheld device]*

**Entrepreneur:** "This cartridge I'm holding? It runs on this retro handheld. It runs in a web browser. It runs on a Raspberry Pi. It runs on an industrial controller in a factory. **Same file. Zero modifications.**

We're not just building a gaming platform. We're building the universal runtime for portable interactive experiences."

---

### THE QUESTIONS

**Kevin O'Leary:** "Okay, I like the pitch, but I'm a numbers guy. What are your revenues?"

**Entrepreneur:** "We launched the marketplace four months ago. We're at $47,000 in monthly GMV—that's gross merchandise value—with a 20% platform take. So about $9,400 in monthly revenue, growing 35% month-over-month."

**Kevin:** "So you're doing over $100K annualized already?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Closer to $115K at current run rate, but the trajectory puts us at $500K ARR by end of year if growth continues."

**Mark Cuban:** "How many creators are on the platform?"

**Entrepreneur:** "We have 2,300 registered creators. 340 have published cartridges. Average creator has 4 cartridges, average price is $12."

**Lori Greiner:** "And what's the customer acquisition cost?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Effectively zero right now. The retro gaming community is tight-knit. We partnered with three YouTubers who make content about retro handhelds—they drove 80% of our signups because our platform solves a real problem for their audience."

**Robert Herjavec:** "What problem exactly?"

**Entrepreneur:** "These handheld devices—Anbernic, Miyoo, dozens of brands—they sell millions of units but have terrible software ecosystems. Every device has different firmware, different emulators, different configurations. We unify all of it. One platform. One format. Works everywhere."

---

### THE MOMENT

**Kevin O'Leary:** "I want to understand the moat here. What stops Nintendo or Sony from crushing you?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Great question, Kevin. Two things.

First, they don't want this market. They make money on expensive consoles and $60 games. Our creators sell $5-15 experiences. It's beneath their business model.

Second, and this is the real moat—we're not competing on gaming. Gaming is our beachhead. But our architecture..."

*[Pulls up a tablet showing the Blu-Prince visual editor]*

**Entrepreneur:** "...is actually a visual programming environment for state machines. The same technology that powers our games can power IoT device interfaces, industrial control panels, training simulations, even web hosting configurations.

We have three enterprise pilots starting next quarter. A manufacturing company wants to replace their $200,000 SCADA training system with our cartridges. Cost to them? $15,000 annually."

**Mark Cuban:** *[Sits up straight]* "Wait. You're telling me the same platform that makes retro games can replace enterprise software?"

**Entrepreneur:** "Exactly. A finite state machine doesn't care if it's controlling a video game character or a industrial process flow. The visualization is different. The logic engine is identical."

**Mark:** "That's actually... that's really smart."

### THE FEEDING FRENZY

**Kevin O'Leary:** "Alright, I'm going to make you an offer. I'll give you the $500,000, but I want 25% of the company, plus a $1 royalty on every cartridge sold until I recoup my investment."

**Entrepreneur:** "Kevin, I appreciate the offer, but a royalty would undercut our creator economics. Our whole value proposition is giving creators the best take rate in the industry."

**Kevin:** "That's the offer. Take it or leave it."

**Mark Cuban:** "I'm going to jump in here because I think Kevin's missing something important."

*[Kevin rolls his eyes]*

**Mark:** "You mentioned web hosting configurations. Explain that more."

**Entrepreneur:** "Sure. Right now, if you want to set up a website, you're dealing with opaque cloud pricing. AWS bills that surprise you. Services that don't talk to each other.

Imagine instead: you go to a visual editor—our Blu-Prince tool—and you literally drag and drop the services you need. SSL certificate cartridge. Database cartridge. CDN cartridge. Email service cartridge. Each has a fixed monthly price. You see the total before you commit. You can swap providers with one click because the cartridge format is standardized."

**Mark:** "And the providers would pay to be in your marketplace?"

**Entrepreneur:** "That's the enterprise play. We become the Kayak of infrastructure. Providers compete for customers on a level playing field. We take a referral fee. Customers get predictable pricing and easy migration."

**Mark:** "Here's my offer. $500,000 for 12%. But I want board advisor status, and I want first right of refusal on your Series A."

**Daymond John:** "Hold on, I haven't said anything yet. This has licensing potential written all over it. These handheld manufacturers—they need a software ecosystem. You could license TingOS to them, take a per-device fee."

**Entrepreneur:** "We've actually had preliminary conversations with two manufacturers. They're interested, but they want to see more traction first."

**Daymond:** "I can make those calls. I know people at Walmart who buy millions of these devices for the holiday season. I'll give you $500,000 for 15%, but I'm the one who gets you in those doors."

**Mark Cuban:** "I'll match the 15%, and I'll help you with the enterprise side. Cloud infrastructure is my world."

---

### THE CLOSE

**Lori Greiner:** "I'm going to throw something out there. What if Mark and Daymond go in together? You get Mark's tech connections and Daymond's retail and licensing expertise. That's a powerful combination."

**Mark:** *[Looks at Daymond]* "I'd do that. $500,000, split between us, for 20% total. 10% each. You get two sharks who cover both sides of your business."

**Daymond:** "I'm in if you're in."

*[The entrepreneur pauses, calculating]*

**Entrepreneur:** "Sharks, I came in asking for 10%. You're asking for 20%, which values the company at $2.5 million. Our current run rate and growth trajectory suggests we'll be worth significantly more in 12 months.

But... I recognize that having both of you opens doors that pure capital doesn't. Mark, your credibility in enterprise tech is unmatched. Daymond, your retail and licensing network is exactly what we need for the hardware partnerships.

I'll accept $500,000 for 18%, split evenly between you. That's my final counter."

**Mark:** *[Looks at Daymond, who nods]* "Deal."

*[They shake hands. Kevin O'Leary throws his hands up in mock frustration.]*

**Kevin:** "You're all crazy! You just gave away 18% of a company that's barely profitable!"

**Mark:** "Kevin, in two years this company is going to be licensing to every device manufacturer and every enterprise training department in America. $500,000 is going to look like the steal of the decade."

**Kevin:** "We'll see."
